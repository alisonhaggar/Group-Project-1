# Group-Project-1
This project will require all six of you to work together and set some ground rules as you will each build part of it.
Your mission is to create a program that implements a number of ciphers.  The user can select which cypher to use.  They then type their message and press enter to confirm.  The program will then display the encrypted message.
Alternatively, if you provide the program with an encrypted message and the name of the cipher with which it was encrypted, the program should be able to return the plain english translation.
The cyphers you need to encode are as follows: The Reverse Cipher, The Caesar Cipher, The Transposition Cipher and the Affine Cipher.
One student should manage the project with responsibility for setting coding standards and may also pair program with the student responsible for writing the main body code.  The remaining students should pick a cipher each.  They can either work separately, or in pairs, using the following online book for guidance: http://inventwithpython.com/cracking/

Good luck!
